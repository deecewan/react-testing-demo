# Testing React Components

Like most modern JS projects, there is a *lot* of boilerplate, and a lot of packages required to get started.

The packages required are:

- babel-core
- babel-jest
- babel-polyfill
- babel-preset-latest     ---| these two are just
- babel-preset-stage-0    ---| my personal preference
- babel-preset-react
- enzyme
- jest
- react
- react-dom
- react-addons-test-utils
- react-test-renderer
